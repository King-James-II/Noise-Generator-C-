# Noise Generator Application

This program creates a NoiseGen class that generates clean and noisy arrays of values, and then prints them to the console. The NoiseGen class contains methods to generate values, add noise to the clean array, and print the values in a tabular format. The main class instantiates the NoiseGen object and calls its methods to perform the operations.

## Key Features:
- **Clean and Noisy Array Generation**: Generates clean and noisy arrays of values based on mathematical calculations and random noise.
- **User-Defined Noise Factor**: Allows the user to specify a noise factor to control the level of noise added to the clean array.
- **Tabular Output**: Prints the generated values in a tabular format to the console, showing the element number, clean value, and noisy value.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Utilizes classes and methods to organize and encapsulate the functionality of the program.

## Technologies and Concepts Covered:
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Implements classes, objects, and methods to encapsulate related functionality and promote code reusability.
- **Random Number Generation**: Utilizes the `Random` class to generate random numbers for adding noise to the clean array.
- **Array Manipulation**: Creates and modifies arrays to store clean and noisy values.
- **Mathematical Operations**: Performs mathematical calculations to generate clean values based on the sine function.
- **Console Output Formatting**: Prints values to the console in a formatted tabular layout for easy readability.
